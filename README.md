# Novell AXT Extractor version 1.0
# Written 9/28/2005

Description: Reconstructs Novell packages of installed Windows software for DRM-free use

This source code is very old, but worked very well during the Windows XP era.
This may not support newer AXT files.

(Test code is left in the comments to avoid accidentally deleting and breaking code.)

Requires an AXT and DEF file in the EXE's directory to extract. Drag and Drop might work.
